# AWS Automation with Python

This repository contains Python scripts for automating various tasks on AWS, including creating EC2 snapshots, cleaning up snapshots, checking EC2 and EKS status, taking volume backups, restoring volumes, monitoring a website, and automating notifications and server restarts.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed
- Boto3 library for AWS interactions: `pip install boto3`
- Requests library for website monitoring: `pip install requests`

Make sure to set up your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by exporting environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
export AWS_REGION=your_aws_region


Certainly! Here's a basic template for a README file that explains how to create EC2 snapshots, cleanup snapshots, check EC2 and EKS status, take a volume backup, restore a volume, monitor a website, and automate notifications and server restart using Python. Feel free to customize it according to your specific needs.
